# Async-VFS: Asynchronous Virtual File System

Async-VFS is a cutting-edge library designed to simulate a file system in memory, leveraging the power of promises for asynchronous file operations. This library provides developers with the flexibility to read, write, delete, and manage directories and files asynchronously, without the overhead of disk I/O. It also features an event model for real-time tracking of file system changes, a lightweight caching system for performance enhancement, and seamless integration with existing asynchronous file operation libraries.

## Features

- **Virtual File System with Promises**: Simulate file system operations in memory using promises for asynchronous read, write, and delete operations.
- **Event Model for File System Changes**: Subscribe to and handle asynchronous events for file additions, deletions, and modifications, enabling real-time response to changes.
- **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: Fetch virtual files via HTTP requests, treating virtual file data as if interacting with real files.
- **Lightweight Caching System**: Enhance performance with an asynchronous caching system, maintaining quick access to virtual files while ensuring data consistency through cache invalidation principles.
- **Integration with Asynchronous Libraries**: Extend functionality with easy integration into existing asynchronous libraries like async.js or Bluebird, simplifying asynchronous operations within the virtual file system.
- **CLI Tool**: Interact with the virtual file system through a command-line interface, executing asynchronous file operations directly from the terminal.
- **Error Handling and Operation Cancellation**: Robust error handling for asynchronous operations with support for operation cancellation, allowing developers to manage errors and cancel operations efficiently.

## Getting Started

To start using Async-VFS, install the library in your project:

```bash
npm install async-vfs
```

### Quick Examples

#### Reading a Virtual File

```javascript
const vfs = require('async-vfs');

vfs.readFile('/path/to/virtual/file.txt').then(content => {
  console.log(content);
}).catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

#### Watching for File Changes

```javascript
vfs.watchFile('/path/to/virtual/file.txt', (event, filename) => {
  console.log(`${filename} was ${event}`);
});
```

## API Reference

### File Operations

- `readFile(path)`: Asynchronously reads the content of a virtual file.
- `writeFile(path, data)`: Asynchronously writes data to a virtual file.
- `deleteFile(path)`: Asynchronously deletes a virtual file.

### Directory Operations

- `createDirectory(path)`: Asynchronously creates a new directory.
- `deleteDirectory(path)`: Asynchronously deletes a directory and its contents.

### Event Handling

- `watchFile(path, callback)`: Subscribes to changes on a virtual file.
- `watchDirectory(path, callback)`: Subscribes to changes within a virtual directory.

### HTTP Requests

- `fetchFile(url)`: Asynchronously fetches a virtual file over HTTP.

### Caching

- `cacheFile(path)`: Caches a virtual file asynchronously.
- `invalidateCache(path)`: Invalidates the cache for a virtual file.

## CLI Usage

Async-VFS comes with a CLI for direct interaction with the virtual file system. Use the following commands to perform operations from your terminal:

```bash
vfs read /path/to/virtual/file.txt
vfs write /path/to/virtual/file.txt "Hello, Async-VFS!"
vfs delete /path/to/virtual/file.txt
```

## Error Handling

Async-VFS ensures that all asynchronous operations are wrapped in robust error handling mechanisms. Use try-catch blocks or promise catch methods to handle errors gracefully.
